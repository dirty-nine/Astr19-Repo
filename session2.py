'''
Write a Python program that prints the sum of two floating point numbers, the difference between two integers, and the product of a floating point number and an integer. In each case, have the program print out the data type of the resulting answer.

print(f'''
Sum of two floating point ints: 
3.2 + 0.11 = {3.2 + 0.11} 
(ans type:{type(3.2 + 0.11)})

Difference between two ints:
5 + 1 = {5+1} 
(ans type:{type(5+1)})

Product of a float and an int:
8.999 * 9 = {8.999 * 1} 
(ans type:{type(8.999 * 1)})
''')

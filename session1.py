Hi! My name is Nathaniel Wan
My preferred pronouns are he/him
My favorite movie is Konosuba Ledgend of Crimson. I love the intricacies in the character interactions and how funny it is.
My favorite food is chicken. I love that chicken is so versitile. Chicken sandwiches, chicken tenders, chicken nuggets, chicken broth, chicken noodle soup, chicken and waffles, chicken on pizza, chichen flavored ramen -- chicken tastes so good no matter what it is used for!

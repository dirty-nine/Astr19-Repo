'''
Create a Jupyter Notebook where, in separate cells, you define functions that return sin(x) and cos(x).  Use Markdown cells to comment your Notebook, and describe what each function does. Create a third Python cell that will tabulate sin(x) and cos(x) using these previously defined functions vs. x, where x is tabulated between 0 and 2 with a thousand entries. Write a fourth Python cell that will use a for loop to print out the first 10 values of x, sin(x), and cos(x) in columns
